# object-getter

In this task a get function that gets an object and the path to a nested property of an object 
and returns the value of that property (or undefined if the property doesn't exist) were created.

The third, optional argument to the function is the default value that is returned if the value in the specified path does not exist.

Testing of the function had the expected outputs
